My daughter Gabrielle is joining the ranks of the Lisperati!

I have three daughters, and they are phenomenal - see for yourself:

All three take honors courses; and instead of encouraging them to do extracurricular activities, I feel like I need to stop them from doing too much.

They're independant, though; so its best to let them follow their own path.

After I've scouted it out, of course.

###Guess Where Gabby's Path is Leading Her?

Towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science" target="_blank">AP Computer Science</a>, starting next fall!

I feel like I drank a glass of Christmas, spiked with my birthday!

She's concerned that Computer Science will be difficult, and asked me to help her learn programming. So, I told her about Racket and segued into the power of Lisp - and she mentioned that she had heard <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_blank">Ruby</a> was cool, and she would like to learn how to code in Ruby.

###Waylaid by the Orcs of the Ruby Gem!
Ruby is cool; I'm not going to dis it. I wrote some Ruby code today, as part of my job. And I'll write some tomorrow, and I'll enjoy it - there are far worse things in life than coding in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GpOfwbFRcs" target="_blank">the cool kids'</a> lingua franca. Like cleaning toilets, or being mauled by a grizzly bear, or writing javascript.

It seems that <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> is one reason that Ruby was suggested as a first language for Gabby. Another reason is that Ruby programmers are in demand.

###Two Roads Diverged in a Wood
However, Gabby stated that she would like to code games, and I know that she doesn't need to accomodate today's job market. It makes more sense for her to learn a language that gets her past the syntax and into core computer science and programming concepts quickly and easily.

Perhaps a programming language that is dead simple to install, and comes with an <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/" target="_blank">integrated editor and REPL</a>? With an amazing community and a fantastic book</a> that teaches you how to <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/realmofracket.htm" target="_blank">program, one game at a time</a>?

After our initial impasse, Gabby and I reached an understanding - we'll start doing two sessions a week, starting in 2 weeks (she's got to get through the ACT exam first).

And I ordered her a copy of <a href="http://www.nostarch.com/realmofracket.htm" target="_blank">Realm of Racket</a> :)

###Gabby Chose the Path to Racket!

She can still learn Ruby after she gets a handle on Lisp, but that might be like going back to high school after she graduates college.
